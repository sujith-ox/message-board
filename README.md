### ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project running.

#### **1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sujith-ox/message-board.git
cd message-board
```

#### **2. Set up the project**

First, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

  * On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
  * On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

Next, install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install just Django: `pip install django`.

#### **3. Apply migrations**

Django automatically handles database setup with its migration system.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

#### **4. Run the development server**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
